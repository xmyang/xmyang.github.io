        <p><strong> Q-BA here is referring new BA who acted as a QA before, just like me…</strong></p>
<p>I acts as QA in the last two years, and although I tried to do some stuff related to business, however, it is slightly different when I acts as a full-time BA in the current project.</p>
<p>In one word, I think the difference is, as QA, I accept the fact that all the behaviors is well-considered and good enough, then the only think I need to check is if they are working well.</p>
<p>However, as BA, I think I should be more critical of the proposed option, and try to find if it is really suitable for the business needs.</p>
<h3 id="Lesson1-Does-sad-path-really-matter"><a href="#Lesson1-Does-sad-path-really-matter" class="headerlink" title="Lesson1: Does sad path really matter?"></a>Lesson1: Does sad path really matter?</h3><p>From QA perspective, especially when most of happy path is guaranteed by kinds of tests, then finding evil scenarios to break the application is really important in my QA career.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of the BA career, I always tend to find out all sad paths for the scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When</strong> I am working on the story elaboration of one story” save and send email”, which is about asking the user email, then send the product info to the user via email.</p>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<p><strong>From QA perspective,</strong></p>
<p>I mainly focusing on handling the bad path, how about it is empty, how about if it is too long, how about if it is not well-formatted<br>    …</p>
<p><strong>From BA perspective,</strong></p>
<p>First thing is to see if it makes sense to ask user to input it again, how about pre-populate it since it is asked before? …</p>
<h3 id="Lesson2-Do-not-be-pulled-into-details-too-much"><a href="#Lesson2-Do-not-be-pulled-into-details-too-much" class="headerlink" title="Lesson2: Do not be pulled into details too much!"></a>Lesson2: Do not be pulled into details too much!</h3><p>From QA perspective, I did many scenario testing(system capability for user to achieve specific goal) and story testing(provide/get fast feedback along the story development process).</p>
<p>So I prefer to go to details as per each scenario, and try to evolve more detailed scenario.</p>
<p>Then from BA perspective, the whole part is more important than focusing on the small part and detailed information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given</strong> we are working on the project in the initiate phase</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> prototype comes passed from Business to us for reference</p>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<p><strong>From QA perspective,</strong></p>
<p>I mainly find flaws as per each section, and to check the text field and buttons behaviors.</p>
<p>I mainly find if any spelling errors around all the wording and text…</p>
<p><strong>From BA perspective,</strong></p>
<p><em>[I need to think more like UX]</em></p>
<p>Do we need to schedule user testing or expert review of the prototype to see if the design makes sense?</p>
<p><em>[I need to think more like Dev]</em></p>
<p>What’s the integration points among the system with other systems?</p>
<p>If the wording and text need to be approved by legal team?…</p>
<h3 id="Lesson3-Go-directly-to-the-business-for-any-need"><a href="#Lesson3-Go-directly-to-the-business-for-any-need" class="headerlink" title="Lesson3: Go directly to the business for any need"></a>Lesson3: Go directly to the business for any need</h3><p>From QA perspective, sometimes I will firstly go to BA if some puzzles happen.And then go to business if necessary.</p>
<p>Then from BA perspective, if any puzzle happen, go to the people you need to ask for answers. Don’t Wait!</p>
<h3 id="Lesson4-Facilitation-skills-matter-a-lot"><a href="#Lesson4-Facilitation-skills-matter-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="Lesson4: Facilitation skills matter a lot"></a>Lesson4: Facilitation skills matter a lot</h3><p>As a BA, the facilitation skill is important to gather the clarification and solution.</p>
<p>There are many scenarios you need to facilitate the meeting at the inception phase of the project, or during daily business discussion, IPM and meetings.</p>
<p><em>I just realized the importance, and I think the book <the secret="" of="" facilitation=""> is really cool, thanks kangkang’s recommendation.</the></em></p>
